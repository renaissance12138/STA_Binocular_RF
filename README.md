# STA_Binocular_RF
Humans and animals integrate visual inputs from both eyes in the primary visual cortex (V1) to construct a three-dimensional perception of the world. This code implements the Spike-Triggered Average (STA) method to calculate and visualize binocular receptive fields from real neuronal electrophysiological data.
